# BSC AI Factory

Welcome to the **BSC AI Factory** GitHub organization.  
This space hosts a curated selection of software resources aligned with the mission of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) to advance applied Artificial Intelligence, High-Performance Computing, and data-driven innovation.

## Repository Structure

The organization contains two types of repositories:

### 1. `external-resources` — Curated External Resources  
A central repository that aggregates **vetted links and references** to external software development resources relevant to AI, HPC, and data engineering.  
This includes:

- Recommended tools, libraries, and frameworks  
- Best-practice guides and reference materials  
- External examples or templates selected by the AI Factory team  

This repository contains **only curated references**, not proprietary code.

### 2. Curated Internal Repositories (Forks)  
The organization also hosts **forks of selected internal BSC repositories**, provided by different technical teams, that:

- Illustrate reusable components, examples or utilities  
- Are suitable for external visibility  
- Support AI Factory activities and collaboration  

These repositories preserve their original internal structure while exposing only material appropriate for public sharing.

## Purpose of This Organization

- Serve as a public-facing access point to the BSC AI Factory’s technical and software-related materials 
- Share reusable technical assets developed within BSC  
- Highlight curated resources aligned with strategic AI/HPC priorities  
- Support collaborators, partners, and ecosystem stakeholders with accessible materials
